    <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL) is a fully owned subsidiary of Air India Limited, formed with
        an aim to provide unified Ground Handling services (Ramp, Passenger & Baggage and Cargo Handling) at most of the
        airports in India under the brand name 'Air India Airport Services'.
    </p>

    <p>

        From the time the very first aircraft took flight in India, till today, when Jumbos and Dreamliners rule the
        sky, Air India's Ground Handling Department always existed, albeit under different names. What started off as a
        section for Ground Handling under Air India Engineering, grew into a department called Ground Services
        Department with the induction B747 "jumbo” aircraft.
    </p>

    <p>


        With a view to bring in focus on the core Ground Handling services, the Passenger, Cargo and Ramp Handling
        activities have been brought together to form the Ground Handling subsidiary AIATSL. With an experienced
        workforce of over four decades, sophisticated GSE, and Air India’s expertise of over 75 years in Aviation
        business, Air India Airport Services has endeavored to provide excellent Ground Handling services at all times.
        While Ground Services Department of Air India was the first Ground Service provider to obtain ISO 9002
        certification, its subsidiary AIATSL has further achieved IATA's ISAGO Certification.
